### CardiacRecorder
A application that stores the records of systolic, diastolic pressure and heart rate of a person according to specific date and time. This app is developed on android 
studio. For the database record we used firebase.

### This app allows user to 
• show a list of measurements
• add a new measurement (which always appends to the bottom end of the list)
• view and edit the details of an existing measurement
• delete a measurement
• see unusual blood pressures highlighted or flagged.
